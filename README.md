# Factors Driving Public Health
This repository contains the code and report for our final project for the Data Science Practicum course at Virginia Tech.

## Overview
In collaboration with Sam Walmsley from the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), our project investigates the potential correlation between various factors related to restaurants, food availability, and public health outcomes in Virginia counties.

Specifically, we aim to:

* Identify variables related to restaurants and food availability
* Quantify public health outcomes like obesity and diabetes rates
* Analyze potential correlations between these variables
* Create a predictive model to analyze potential future health outcomes

## Contents
The repository contains the following:

* data: Folder containing the raw and cleaned data used for analysis
* code: Folder containing R and Python code for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling
* output: Folder containing output files like figures and tables
* report: Final report summarizing project goals, data, methods, results, and conclusions (PDF)
## Usage
The main scripts for reproducing the analysis are:

* data_cleaning.R: Cleans and preprocesses raw data
* lasso_regression.R: Performs lasso regression for feature selection
* predictive_modeling.py: Trains gradient boosting model to predict obesity rates
## Requirements
The code requires the following R and Python packages:

* R
  - dplyr
  - glmnet
  - ggplot2
   
* Python
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
